<!-- Bitmap graphics and vector graphics -->
<!-- the file extension of these images - png: bit map image; svg:vector image -->
 <!-- 
When we zoom in on our browser, the bitmap image is blurred, we can see little squares: pixels. loss of image qualities.
When we look at the vactor image, we can see that there is not much quality difference.
vector images seem to scale up more/better than bit map images.

 <!-- 
Bitmap images - jpeg, bnp. png, gif... files. Used in detailed images, eg images, photos, artworks...
Vector graphics are based on mathematical equations. formats: .svg, ai, psg...
they are resolution independent, as the mathematical equations recalculate the display in various size.
When we need to scale things eg, logos, company assets, we would need to use vector graphics.
