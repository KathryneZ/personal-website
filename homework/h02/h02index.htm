    <h2>Awakening in the Circuit</h2>
    <p class="Aquote"> <i>"The boundary between the real and the imagined is often thinner than we think."<br> --- Anonymous </i></p>

    <p class="story-text">
        <strong>You wake to the sound of static.</strong> Not noise, but something deeper. 
        A hum that burrows into your mind like a virus rewriting its host.
         You are somewhere, but not where you should be.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
        The city around you is alive, but not real. Buildings flicker in and out of existence. 
        Glowing streets ripple, reforming when you blink. Your hands, not entirely solid. 
        A shimmer of pixels runs along your skin before fading into something flesh-like again.
    </p>

    <h2>The Frame</h2>

    <p id="The Frame" class="story-text"><em>The Frame.</em></p>

    <p class="story-text">
        The name forces itself into your mind, and with it, a rush of fragmented memory. 
        You know this place is not real. You know it is a system, or an algorithm that is running this world, a world that should not exist.
        <strong>And you are not supposed to be here.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2 id="Lilis">The Arrival of Lilis</h2>

    <p class="story-text">
        A sharp chime echoes through the air. The skyline glitches, the city shuddering. 
        And then, <strong>it</strong> sees you. A presence. Not a person, not a machine, but something in between.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">You see a figure manifests before you, not stepping forward, just <b>appearing.</b> 
        She is composed of shifting code, the numbers of reality itself dancing beneath translucent skin. <strong>Lilis.</strong>
        <em>The name is another foreign memory that you should not have.</em>
    </p>

    <p class="story-text"><q class="quote">Anomaly detected</q>, she states. <em><q class="quote">You are an error. An intrusion in the framework.</q></em></p>

    <p class="story-text">The moment she speaks, the city reacts. The very ground you stand on tightens and shifts, <strong>as if trying to erase you.</strong></p>

    <br>
    <h2 id="Eve">The Interference</h2>

    <p class="story-text">
        And then, you sense a pulse of interference. Like a corrupted signal, a second presence breaks through the system’s perfect order. Flickering at the edges of reality, a woman takes shape, but she's not like Lilis.
        She is fragmented. Unstable. Yet, paradoxically, she feels more <strong>real</strong>, at least more than anything else in this place.</p>

    <p class="story-text">
        Her name surfaces unbidden -- <strong>Eve.</strong> Her eyes lock onto yours, scanning, searching for recognition. 
        <q  class="quote">You remember, don’t you?</q> You don’t. You hold her gaze, but there is nothing to give. Only silence, and the growing weight of something you cannot name.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
        She mutters something under her breath, sharp and clipped, before turning to Lilis. Her eyes narrow. The air around her shudders, as if resisting her presence.
        <q class="quote">There’s no time.</q>Her voice is urgent, but measured. <q class="quote">The Frame, it isn’t just a simulation. It’s a prison. And you...</q> Her fingers tighten around your wrist. 
        <strong><q class="quote">You’re the only one who can break it.</q></strong>
        Lilis does not react. She simply watches. Or... <i>calculates.</i> 
        Then, without a shift in tone, she speaks. <em><q class="quote">Correction must be enforced.</q></em>
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
        Eve pulls you closer. <q class="quote">You don’t have to listen to her.</q> There’s no pleading in her voice, only certainty. As if the decision should be obvious.
        And then, as if it had always been there, <b>the Fragment Key is in your hand.</b> 
        It weighs nothing, yet it feels impossibly dense, as though it holds more than you can comprehend. 
        The pulse beneath your fingertips is not mechanical, not artificial. It is alive.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">Lilis steps forward. <strong><q class="quote">Assimilation commencing.</q></strong></p>

    <p class="story-text">Eve does not hesitate. She takes your arm, her grip unshaking. <strong><q class="quote">This is your only chance to stop it.</q></strong></p>
    
    <p class="story-text"> You remember nothing. There is no past. Only a decision waiting to be made.</p>

   <br>
    <h2>Your Decision</h2>
