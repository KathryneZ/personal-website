    <h1>The Collapse of The Frame</h1>

    <p class="story-text"><b>You release the Fragment Key.</b> The moment it touches Lilis' core, the system convulses,
        logic fractures, algorithms splinter. The Frame cannot contain the disruption.
        Data streams crash, the skyline disintegrates into nothingness.
        <em><q class="quote">You misunderstood,</q></em> Lilis murmurs, her voice flickering like a corrupted file.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">The Frame collapses, its digital skeleton imploding in on itself. <strong>The last construct of humanity’s design vanishes.</strong></p>

    <h2>The Awakening</h2>

    <p class="story-text">
        You wake. The sun is out. The air is crisp. A faint breeze stirs the leaves in the trees.
        Somewhere in the distance, the sound of traffic. A bird calls, then another. 
        The street outside is wet, as if it rained earlier, though the pavement is already drying. 
        You hear footsteps as you see someone walking past, a phone held to their ear. 
        A bus exhales at a stoplight. 
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
        You sit up. The sheets are familiar. The room around you is neither strange nor significant. 
        The door is slightly ajar, the way you always leave it. A clock ticks from somewhere behind you, steady and constant.
        You run a hand over your face. It is warm, solid.The memories of The Frame slip further away, like the details of a dream fading in the first moments of waking. 
    </p>
    <p class="story-text"><strong>Were you really there? Or had you simply imagined it?</strong></p>
    
    <p class="story-text">
        It doesn’t matter. You stand, stretch, step toward the window. The world continues.
    </p>
