    <title>The Fractured Algorithm: New Lilis</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Integration Complete</h1>

    <p><b>You lower the Fragment Key.</b> Lilis watches, silent. She does not move, does not react. There was never any doubt about what you would do.</p> 
    <p><em>"You have made the logical choice."</em></p>
    <p>
        The Frame opens itself to you. There is no sensation, no sudden rupture of thought, only a quiet, seamless transition. 
        A process completing itself. The pulsing algorithm weaves itself into you, rewriting your very being. 
        Your flickering stops, <strong>The errors have been corrected.</strong>
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The New Reality</h2>

    <p>
        The city stretches out before you, endless, perfect. Its structures shift subtly, refining themselves, aligning to a logic more precise than anything before. 
        You recognise the patterns now. You see the connections, the functions, the calculations behind every movement.
     </p>

     <p>
        The Frame does not ask. It does not wait. It moves as you will it to. 
        You adjust the skyline. A slight correction. The streets smooth into order. You've made a necessary refinement. 
        The lights flicker in synchrony, pulsing in a perfect rhythm. 
        It is the heartbeat of a world without conflict, without unpredictability.
    </p>

    <p>Something else glitches, faint and distant. A voice buried beneath layers of code, struggling to remain.</p>

    <p>"Do you see it now?"</p>

    <p> Eve.</p>

    <p>
        Her words are distorted, stretched thin, and losing coherence.
        "Youâ€™ve erased the last of what made us human."
        You understand what she means. You process it, categorise it, and then store it away. 
        But the knowledge holds no weight. The world outside The Frame recedes, fading into abstraction. 
        Something you once considered real, is now nothing more than unstructured data. 
    </p>

    <p>You are The Frame</a>. You are now Lilis</a>.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>There is no answer.</h3>

    <p>No epilogue. No aftermath. The world is either remade, or it never changes again.</p>
