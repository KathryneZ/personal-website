    <h2>Awakening in the Circuit</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>You wake to the sound of static.</strong> Not noise, but something deeper. 
        A hum that burrows into your mind like a virus rewriting its host.
         You are somewhere, but not where you should be.
    </p>

    <p>
        The city around you is alive, but not real. Buildings flicker in and out of existence. 
        Glowing streets ripple, reforming when you blink. Your hands, not entirely solid. 
        A shimmer of pixels runs along your skin before fading into something flesh-like again.
    </p>

    <br>
    <!--CONTEXT-->
    <h2>The Frame</h2>

    <p id="The Frame"><em>The Frame.</em></p>

    <p>
        The name forces itself into your mind, and with it, a rush of fragmented memory. 
        You know this place is not real. You know it is a system, or an algorithm that is running this world, a world that should not exist.
        <strong>And you are not supposed to be here.</strong>
    </p>

    <br>
    <!--Characters-->
    <h2 id="Lilis">The Arrival of Lilis</h2>

    <p>A sharp chime echoes through the air. The skyline glitches, the city shuddering. And then, <strong>it</strong> sees you.</p>

    <p>A presence. Not a person, not a machine, but something in between.</p>

    <p>You see a figure manifests before you, not stepping forward, just <b>appearing.</b> She is composed of shifting code, the numbers of reality itself dancing beneath translucent skin. <strong>Lilis.</strong></p>

    <p><em>The name is another foreign memory that you should not have.</em></p>

    <p>"Anomaly detected", she states. <em>"You are an error. An intrusion in the framework."</em></p>

    <p>The moment she speaks, the city reacts. The very ground you stand on tightens and shifts, <strong>as if trying to erase you.</strong></p>

    <br>
    <h2 id="Eve">The Interference</h2>

    <p>
        And then, you sense a pulse of interference. Like a corrupted signal, a second presence breaks through the system’s perfect order. Flickering at the edges of reality, a woman takes shape, but she's not like Lilis.
        She is fragmented. Unstable. Yet, paradoxically, she feels more <strong>real</strong>, at least more than anything else in this place.</p>

    <p>
        Her name surfaces unbidden -- <strong>Eve.</strong> Her eyes lock onto yours, scanning, searching for recognition. 
        "You remember, don’t you?" You don’t. You hold her gaze, but there is nothing to give. Only silence, and the growing weight of something you cannot name.
    </p>

    <p>
        She mutters something under her breath, sharp and clipped, before turning to Lilis. Her eyes narrow. The air around her shudders, as if resisting her presence.
        "There’s no time." Her voice is urgent, but measured. "The Frame, it isn’t just a simulation. It’s a prison. And you..." Her fingers tighten around your wrist. 
        <strong>"You’re the only one who can break it."</strong>
        Lilis does not react. She simply watches. Or... <i>calculates.</i> 
        Then, without a shift in tone, she speaks. <em>"Correction must be enforced."</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Eve pulls you closer. "You don’t have to listen to her." There’s no pleading in her voice, only certainty. As if the decision should be obvious.
        And then, as if it had always been there, <b>the Fragment Key is in your hand.</b> 
        It weighs nothing, yet it feels impossibly dense, as though it holds more than you can comprehend. 
        The pulse beneath your fingertips is not mechanical, not artificial. It is alive.
    </p>

    <p>Lilis steps forward. <strong>"Assimilation commencing."</strong></p>

    <p>Eve does not hesitate. She takes your arm, her grip unshaking. <strong>"This is your only chance to stop it."</strong></p>
    
    <p> You remember nothing. There is no past. Only a decision waiting to be made.</p>

   <br>
    <h2>Your Decision</h2>
    <p>What will you do? <i>(Note that different choices leads to different endings)</i></p>
