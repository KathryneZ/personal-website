    <h1>NM2207 Project Diary Entry 01</h1>
    <p>
        My final project is a combined spending and mood tracker 
        that allows users to input income or expenses by category and log their daily mood using an interactive calendar. 
        The aim is to create a visually clean interface that encourages reflection on financial habits and emotional patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
        This week, I focused on building the overall layout/framework using HTML and CSS, 
        following the planned layout I had drawn out (see below).
        <div> <img src="images/diary1-1.jpg" width="500"> </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        I implemented two main buttons for adding expenses and income, styled responsively with colour differentiation (red and green). 
        When clicked, each button triggers a pop-up form that allows users to input transaction details (amount, category, description, date). 
        I also structured the main layout into two columns: the left for categorised financial records, and the right for a mood tracker. 
        The calendar displays 30 days, and I plan to generate this with JavaScript, with each cell clickable to prep for future mood-tagging functions.
    </p>
    <p>
        After that, I continued sketching out more UI ideas, including the rough user experience flow (see images below).
        <div> <img src="images/diary1-2.jpg" width="500"> </div>
        <div> <img src="images/diary1-3.jpg" width="500"> </div>
        <div> <img src="images/diary1-4.jpg" width="500"> </div>
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
        My current progress focuses on establishing the basic layout and interaction flow. 
        The HTML structure is mostly completed, with containers and key elements already created. 
        Iâ€™ve also experimented with colour schemes and layout via CSS, and successfully set up the two column structure. 
        In JavaScript, I added event listeners for triggering pop-up forms and have begun using for loops to create calendar cells. 
        These are still early steps toward making the app fully interactive. If time allows, I would also explore more functions for the mood tracker, 
        like playing different music for different mood tagged.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back to the original plan, my next steps will be to implement the mood selection popup and begin linking user inputs to their respective category blocks (for the budget tracker)
        and mood entries on the calendar.
